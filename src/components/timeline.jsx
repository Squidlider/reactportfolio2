                          BBA – Business Information Systems. My time management
                          and organizational skills were sharpened during second
                          year of my studies as I worked as a scrum master for
                          nine months in a game development project. All the
                          game projects I’ve been part of have taught me about
                          prioritizing tasks, because usually sprints were too
                          ambitious and some tasks had to be left to the next
                          round.
